## 📊 From UX to Data-Driven Insight

| Insight Area | Description | Design Impact |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| ⚡ Behavioral Observation | Students struggled with fragmented routines & overworking | Time-blocking & break reminders were introduced |
| 🎯 Funnel Analysis | Key actions (e.g. "Add task") lacked visual emphasis | Increased CTA visibility & size |
| 🔁 Retention Triggers | Lack of feedback created uncertainty | Added micro-interactions (toggle color, emoji confirmation) |
| 📈 Measurable Impact | Visibility & ease-of-use tested via user feedback | Revisions improved navigation, clarity & confidence |
